  /--
    Create a Closure from a signature and a callback function.

    For lifetime management, this is an `IO` function. C functions might store a
    reference to the closure, so we only free it if it is marked for deletion by
    the user.

    Note that this leaks memory if the object is garbage collected before it is
    marked for deletion.

    Mark the closure for deletion.

    The closure is deleted when the object is garbage collected.
